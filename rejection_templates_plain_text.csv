As PMC is a compliant repository for the REF you can deposit the link to make this output compliant.

If you do not have a link, this journal is not compliant with the next Research Excellence Framework (REF) which is scheduled for 2029. An exception permits publishers that do not permit deposits in institutional repositories, as long as it is the 'most appropriate publication'. However, the Heads of Departments will decide which journals will be eligible for exception where REF eligibility is concerned. In the meantime, the open access team are making a note of all outputs that are potentially eligible for exception.
