# Rejection templates tool

[Rejection templates tool](https://rejection-templates.streamlit.app/) is only for Imperial College London repository administrators. It allows users to find and copy the relevant rejection template to reject submissions to Spiral, Imperial's open access institutional repository.

Rejection templates were manually compiled and listed into the '[templates.csv](https://github.com/yusufaliozkan/rejection_templates/blob/main/templates.csv)' dataset.
